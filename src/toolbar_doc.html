<h3>Toolbar class documentation</h3>
<div class="shead">What is this?</div>
<!--  <<< -->
<div class="section">
<p>
This is a generic mechanism for creating an array of one or more buttons
on a web page, which can perform a scripted action or load a url, either
in the current page, or in a popup. It was designed to save a little time,
especially on pages where I have many buttons (two or three per item in a 
list, for example), and to provide a single point of entry when debugging
or looking for a style change.
</p>
<p>
In it's simplest form, the toolbar outputs an array of vertically or 
horizontally (default) placed inputs of type &quot;button&quot; which perform
the configured actions. But, at a second glance, we can see that there is
a secondary &quot;button&quot; generating mechanism, which uses table elements
to create what, to the user, looks and feels like buttons, but which can 
do some extra things, like have an icon on the button. Now your web app can
have buttons just as nice as your normal gui apps.

<div class="shead">But why?</div>
<!-- <<< -->
<div class="section">
<p>
A few reasons, really:
<ul>
<li>saving time on button code generation</li>
<li>providing one robust point of button generation -- less debugging, more
	features, more stability</li>
<li>providing a uniform look to buttons in a set</li>
<li>providing a mechanism for putting icons on buttons</li>
</ul>

<p>
	I tend to do just about all of my coding in VIM. Actually, I stick to using
	the graphical version (GVIM), but sometimes make short trips to the land
	of the console. My reasons are simple: I need a uniform development 
	environment on win32 and linux (because I'm forced to use the first, and
	I love to use the second), and I needed something powerful, yet simple
	and, quite importantly, free. Not just free as in beer -- free as in
	licensing. I believe that the days of closed-source applications are
	over. Commercial apps can still be written: a coder has to eat and feed
	his wife and all that. But your clients deserve disclosure on the source, 
	should you be abducted by aliens or something similar. Or even just so they
	can also hire a hacker to implement features you didn't think of. But
	enough of that.</p>
	<p>Also, whilst VIM may give an initially steep learning curve, and
	seem to contain unnecessary keyboard work, you will find that other
	editors become annoying after you find the true power in vim. Also, very
	few other editors are as ready to adapt to the coder's wishes.</p>
	<p>The point is that you might notice a few commented out &lt;&lt;&lt;'s
	and corresponding &gt;&gt;&gt;'s. This is not an angle-bracket fetish: it's
	my choice for fold markers in vim (thanks to a friend) because curly braces
	cause problems in Tcl (even when commented), and tend to mess up the
	brace-matching for languages that use braces for code blocks, since
	vim cannot always tell what is a code brace, and what is a fold brace.
	You also might notice that I tend to stick to an 80 column line. This can
	make some sections of deep code a little short on space, but it's something
	I do as a matter of style (thanks to the same friend). It makes for
	easier reading on a terminal, and means that the code is more easily
	available to anyone who has time to waste on it.</p>

<div class="shead">Where to begin?</div>
<!--- <<< -->
<div class="section">
<p>
The toolbar class started simple, and usage can be quite simple. First, we
need an instance of the class:
<div class="codeblock"><pre>
$tb = new Toolbar(array(
	&quot;look&quot;	=&gt;	&quot;modern&quot;,
));
</pre></div>
The look defines the engine that is used for button generation, as well as
fundamental behaviour. The &quot;classic&quot; look is the default, and uses
standard inputs for the buttons. The only real advantages with using the
&quot;classic&quot; look are:
<ul>
<li>simpler output</li>
<li>uses the buttons provided by the browser (may integrate better with the 
OS, but may also look really plain or simply bad, especially if you are 
outputting to a browser that is not fully CSS2 complient (such as IE, all the
way up to v6), and you have styling set on your inputs to, for instance, make
text entries look a certain way. Notice how your buttons also end up looking
like that?))</li>
<li>A true &quot;submit&quot; button. Submission with the &quot;modern&quot;
engine requires that the button has some code like: 
&quot;document.myform.submit();&quot;. Not a big deal, but something to bear
in mind</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The &quot;modern&quot; look provides for a slightly sleeker button, but
does use the system default colors for the button coloring. I say sleeker,
and by that I mean that your buttons won't look so fat. Literally. But 
a really great advantage of the &quot;modern&quot; look is the ability to 
include images on the buttons -- making your user interface a little more
intuitive.
</p>
<p>There are some other options for the class interface. Check out the usage
section below</p>
<p>A quick demo of adding a button:
<div class="codeblock"><pre>
$tb-&gt;add_button(array(
	&quot;caption&quot;	=&gt;	&quot;Click me&quot;,
	&quot;code&quot;	=&gt;	&quot;alert('Button clicked');&quot;,
	&quot;img&quot;		=&gt;	&quot;images/button.png&quot;
	&quot;imgpos&quot;	=&gt;	&quot;left&quot;
));
</pre></div>
The above code adds a button with the caption &quot;Click me&quot;, which,
when clicked, pops up an alert with the message &quot;Button clicked&quot;.
The button is rendered with the image <pre>images/button.png</pre> on the
left-hand-side of the button, if that image exists. Simple, hey? 
</p>
<p>How about getting the toolbar onto the page?
<div class="codeblock"><pre>
$tb-&gt;render();
</pre></div>
That's it. Really. And if you wanted to take the html output from a 
<pre>render</pre>
and use it elsewhere, instead of rendering at the point that the 
<pre>render</pre> 
function was called, simply pass the value <pre>false</pre> to the
<pre>render</pre> function, and collect the return value from the output.
</p>

<p>The class constructor as well as the add_button method are each driven with
an array of options. Some are required, some aren't. Here's a table of the
options you can use, as well as their default values:

<p><u>Interaction on the page, with other javascript events / scripts:</u><br>
The only thing you might want to do is programmatically disable a button
on the page, due to some logic in your code. The best way to do this is via
the function <pre>disable_toolbar_btn_byid</pre>, which takes in an id, and
a boolean (true to disable, false to enable). The function takes care of
whatever engine is used, and provides for a consistent interface.
