# php-toolbar
Import from my old phpclasses days

This code was to provide an easier mechanism for spewing
out toolbars, in particular, I wanted an easy way to produce
toolbars with buttons which had images on them. Doesn't sound
very exciting now, but the &lt;button&gt; element wasn't well
used then (I'm not even sure if it was well-supported: this
is even before the beast that was ie6)
